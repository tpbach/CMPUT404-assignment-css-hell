Part 1
======
HTML files came with their own CSS. For the sake of the assignment I commented out or deleted the provided CSS.
I also added a line to reference my CSS file as the stylesheet.

The CSS style I was aiming for was a classic book, but not too old that the paper is becoming dark and yellow.
I decided on a lighter paper background that repeated nicely with standard black font to contrast it nicely.

Some changes to create the desired theme:
- Paragraphs have an indent
- Added paper background
- Changed font to better suit background (Times New Roman)
- Headers all follow a classic look (centered, underlined and not too obnoxious)
- Great Gatsby used a table of contents, ensured it also followed the general theme.
- Images are centered
